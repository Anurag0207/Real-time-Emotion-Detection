#Real-time Emotion Detection with TensorFlow
##Overview
Real-Time Emotion Detection project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on facial expression images to detect seven emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras and deployed in real-time using OpenCV for webcam capture.

##Model Architecture
The emotion detection model architecture is built with TensorFlow and Keras APIs. It consists of multiple layers including separable convolutional, activation, batch normalization, dropout, and pooling layers. For detailed implementation, refer to model.py.

##Training
The model is trained using a labeled dataset of facial expression images. The training process, implemented in train.py, includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The best weights of the trained model are saved to a file for later use in real-time detection.

##Real-Time Emotion Detection
Real-time emotion detection is achieved by loading the pre-trained model and weights using OpenCV for webcam capture. The webcam feed is processed frame by frame, and emotion labels are assigned to each frame based on model predictions. Detected emotions are overlayed on the video feed.

# Real-time-Emotion-Detection
Real-Time Emotion Detection with TensorFlow
This project implements real-time emotion detection using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on facial expression images. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, and it detects emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise.

Model Architecture
The emotion detection model architecture consists of multiple layers of separable convolutional, activation, batch normalization, dropout, and pooling layers. The architecture is defined in the model.py file using the TensorFlow and Keras APIs.

Training
The model is trained using a dataset of facial expression images. The training process is implemented in the train.py file, which includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The best weights of the trained model are saved to a file for later use in real-time detection.

Real-Time Emotion Detection
Real-time emotion detection is achieved using OpenCV for webcam capture and the pre-trained model. The model architecture and weights are loaded from files, and then the webcam feed is processed frame by frame. Emotion labels are assigned to each frame based on the model predictions, and the detected emotions are overlayed on the video feed.
